T1ClientLibrary-Python
================

Python implementation of a T1 API Library. This library consists of Python classes for working with T1 entities using the active record pattern. These modules are all `from module import *` safe â€“ that is, because every class/function name is unique and prefixed by "T1", they will not cause conflicts with each other or with typical Python top-level objects. Nonetheless, it is wiser to import your specific classes.

This library is written for Python 2.7. I have tried to ensure compatibility with 3.x, but this is not guaranteed and should be used at your own risk.
